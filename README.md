Obstacle avoidance robot 
Title: Controlling the car  Atmega32
Description: Autonomous Mobile Robot , The Robot is capable of navigating its surrounding environment without human oversight,and is designed with simple techniques such as using pulse width modulation (PWM) to control the speed of the motor, and using Motor Driver IC L293D to control the movement of the motor and directions.

Drivers: (Ultrasonic Sensor, servo moto,GPIO,Motor Driver IC L293D , Timer, UART, and DC-Motor)

Microcontroller: ATmega32
